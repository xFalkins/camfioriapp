- First version of the `AuditLogService` (beta)
  + Supported events: `dataAccessLog`, `dataModificationLog`, `configChangeLog`, and `securityLog`
  + Usage: `const AuditLogService = await cds.connect.to('audit-log'); await AuditLogService.emit/send('<event>', <data>)`

### Fixed

- Virtual fields are not filtered out before application service handlers
- Clarification: the minimum required Node.js version is 12.18.  Versions < 12.18 might not work.
- `cds build` supports validation of `extension-allowlist` which is replacing `entity-whitelist` or `service-whitelist` with cds-mtx 2.0. Warnings are no longer returned if neither entity-whitelist nor  service-whitelist is defined.
- `cds compile -2 sql/edmx` erroneously wrote excessive compiler output to stderr
- Resolve the correct `enterprise-messaging-shared` credentials from VCAP_SERVICES by default
- `cds compile --to sql` now completes the last SQL statement with a proper semicolon

- Key elements got lost in `cds.linked` when using type refs referring to other key elements
- Tree shaking erroneously removed types `Foo` when only referred to by type refs like `bar : Foo:bar`
- Fixed an error in transaction handling, that lead to db connections not released in rare cases
- SQL names option gets properly propagated
- No longer erroneously exclude entities explicitly marked with `cds.persistence:{table, skip:false}`, as in [cap/samples/suppliers](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples/blob/6b08826af51651f6b31fce8454fbadd23c634b85/suppliers/srv/mashup.cds#L46)

## Version 5.1.4 - 2021-05-12

### Fixed

- Error when using complex type references, as in:
```swift
entity Foo { bar: Tic:tac.toe; }
entity Tic { tac: Composition of { toe:String } }
```

## Version 5.1.3 - 2021-05-12

### Fixed

- `cds` does not check for the min. Node.js on BAS, for now

## Version 5.1.2 - 2021-05-12

### Fixed

- `cds serve` does not run in an infinite bootstrap loop if `cds.server()` is called in `server.js`

## Version 5.1.1 - 2021-05-07

### Fixed

- `cds build` is now always adding `.hdbview, .hdbtable, .hdbconstraint or .hdbindex` plugin mappings to `.hdiconfig` to avoid that deployment is failing in case such files exist in an already deployed container, but are no longer generated.
- `cds compile --dest <dir>` no longer crashes creating the destination folder

## Version 5.1.0 - 2021-05-05

### Added

- Custom error handler via `srv.on('error', function (err, req) { ... })` (beta)
  + Synchroneous modification of passed error only
- `cds.log.format()` for custom log formatting

### Fixed

- `cds build` now correctly handles `message.properties` files used for Nodejs runtime messages if these files have been defined in an i18n content folder located at project root.
- Nodejs custom handlers are now correctly resolved if a dedicated destination folder has been configured for the build task.
- Now, the `.csv` file reader correctly closes open file descriptors to avoid memory leaks during `cds build`.

### Changed

- Clean up obsolete compiler option `snapi`.
- `cds build` is no longer validating Nodejs custom service handlers that have been registered using service `@impl` annotation.

## Version 4.6.6 - 2021-05-05

### Fixed

- Now, the `.csv` file reader correctly closes open file descriptors to avoid memory leaks during `cds build`.
- Fixed i18n handling causing `cds build` to fail with error message `bundle is not iterable`.

## Version 5.0.7 - 2021-04-21

### Fixed

- Internal test stabilizations

## Version 5.0.6 - 2021-04-16

### Fixed

- `cds build` no longer fails with `TypeError: x.startsWith is not a function` in some situations

## Version 5.0.5 - 2021-04-15

### Changed

- Internal errors are no longer decorated with `Please report this`.  People interpreted the text as to only include the stack trace in error reports and to omit other valuable context information.

### Fixed

- `cds build` now correctly creates the deployment layout for multitenant applications (sdc folder contents) that have dedicated folder paths configured for db, srv and app modules.
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` now ignores a `_texts.csv` file again if there is a language-specific file like `_texts_en.csv` present
- `cds env` no longer fails to parse `.env` files with JSON values containing `=` characters

## Version 5.0.4 - 2021-04-07

### Fixed

- `cds build` no longer fails with a `task.apply is not a function` error when used in an npm script.

## Version 5.0.3 - 2021-04-06

### Fixed

- `cds.compile` got thoroughly cleaned up and enhanced as the single API to compile models
- `cds.compile.to.cdl` was missing in 5.0.2
- `cds build` no longer uses reflected CSN which caused odata and EDMX transformation to fail.
  As a consequence language specific EDMX files were missing.

### Removed

The following undocumented, internal functions have been removed.
In case you spotted and used them, please replace as given below.

- `cds.compile.cdl` &rarr; use `cds.compile` instead
- `cds.compile.to.parsed.csn` &rarr; use `cds.parse` instead
- `cds.compile.to.xtended.csn` &rarr; use `cds.compile` instead
- `cds.compile.to.inferred.csn` &rarr; use `cds.compile` instead
- `cds.compile.to.hdi` &rarr; use `cds.compile.to.hdbtable` instead
- `cds.compile.to.hana` &rarr; use `cds.compile.to.hdbcds` instead
- `cds.compile.to.xsuaa` &rarr; still available in CLI thru `cds compile -2 xsuaa`
- `cds.compile.to.serviceinfo` &rarr; still available in CLI thru `cds compile -2 serviceinfo`
- `cds.compile.to['edmx-v2']` &rarr; still available in CLI thru `cds compile -2 edmx-v2`
- `cds.compile.to['edmx-v4']` &rarr; still available in CLI thru `cds compile -2 edmx-v4`
- `cds.compile.to['edmx-w4']` &rarr; still available in CLI thru `cds compile -2 edmx-w4`
- `cds.compile.to['edmx-x4']` &rarr; still available in CLI thru `cds compile -2 edmx-x4`


## Version 5.0.2 - 2021-03-30

### Added

- Ensure correlation id and set intermediate `cds.context` in default `server.js`

### Fixed

- `cds build` no longer aborts for CAP Java SDK based projects with `compiler version 2 not supported` message.

## Version 5.0.1 - 2021-03-25

### Added

- `cds.load.properties` and `cds.parse.properties` to load and parse content in .properties format
- `cds.load.csv` and `cds.parse.csv` to load and parse csv content
- `CDL`, `CQL`, and `CXL` as new global methods for tagged template strings generating [CSN], [CQN], or [CXN] objects
- Fluent API classes provided through `cds.ql` also support tagged template strings now in these methods: `SELECT`, `SELECT.from`, `SELECT.where`, `UPDATE`, `UPDATE.with`, `UPDATE.where`, `INSERT.into`, `DELETE.from`, `DELETE.where`

Example:
```js
let Authors = SELECT `ID` .from `Authors` .where `name like ${'%Brontë%'}`
let Books = SELECT `ID,title` .from `Books` .where `author_ID in ${Authors}`
await UPDATE`Books`.with`x = x-${amount}`.where`ID=${ID}`
```

### Changed

- Minimum required Node.js version is now 12.  Support for Node.js 10 is dropped.
- `req.timestamp` is a Date object now; was a UNIX epoch integer before, i.e., Date.now()

### Fixed

- Fixed race conditions in `cds.serve` leading to broken services
- Fixed typos in API type definitions
- Fixed `cds.reflect.forall` for CSN extensions
- Fixed orphaned `_texts` proxies, causing init from csv to fail with "no such table" errors

## Version 5.0.0 - 2021-03-19

### Added

- MTX APIs are now automatically served when `cds.requires.multitenancy` exists. This renders an application-level server start script for multitenancy unnecessary.
- Auto-connect to a live reload server started by `cds watch`
- `cds.parse` now offers tagged template strings. E.g. const {CDL,CQL,CXL} = cds.parse; CQL`SELECT from Books where stock > 111`.
- `cds.log` now supports config options for Loggers and log levels via `cds.env.log`
- `cds.entity.draft` as a stable way to read from draft data
- `cds.linked` now correctly links, events, action params and results, which were not linked before
- `cds.env.features.skip_unused = 'all'` removes all definitions from csn which are not reachable by defined services. Especially when using comprehensive reuse models, like ODM, this significantly reduces both, memory consumption as well as excess tables and views in databases

### Changed

- Upgraded major version of dependency `@sap/cds-compiler`
- `cds.requires.db.multiTenant` is deprecated. Multitenancy can now be enabled by adding a `cds.requires.multitenancy` configuration.
- `cds deploy --to hana` no longer adds a driver for SAP HANA to `package.json`.  This can be done with `cds add hana`.
- `cds deploy --to hana` no longer adds configuration for SAP HANA to `package.json`.  This can be done with `cds add hana`.
- `cds deploy --to hana` drops support for the classic CAP Java runtime, i.e. longer writes credentials for SAP HANA to `connection.properties`.
- Fiori preview now [loads and shows data initially](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.84.0/#/topic/1cf5c7f5b81c4cb3ba98fd14314d4504) in its list page
- I18n template strings now are replaced in EDMX documents such that they retain their surrounding string.  For example, the `"{i18n>key1} - {i18n>key2}"` template results in `"value1 - value2"`, while previously the first match replaced the entire string, leading to `"value1"`.  This is helpful for the [`Template` strings of `UI.ConnectedFields`](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/ac9fe832df9b8c8d35517c637dba7c0ac2753b0f/vocabularies/UI.xml#L168).
- CDS drops compiler v2 support for classic CAP Java runtime projects. `cds build` returns an error if compiler version 2 is used. For further details regarding migration to CAP Java SDK runtime see https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/migration.

### Fixed

- `cds.connect.to` no longer returns `undefined` in concurrent cases where `connect` is called again while a datasource is about to be connected.
- `cds.log` formerly wrote log and debug output to stderr, now writes that to stdout
- `cds.server` now accepts port `0` as a number
- Race conditions in `cds.serve` and `cds.connect` lead to wrong Service instances to lost handler registrations

### Removed

- Compiler non-snapi support &rarr; see `cds.env.features.snapi` option
- In recent releases we added methods `cds.compile.to.hdbtabledata` and `cds.compile.to.hdbmigration`, intentionally undocumented, as they were meant to be private. Nobody should ever have used these methods, hence nobody should be affected by their removal.

## Version 4.6.5 - 2021-03-12

### Fixed

- `cds build` now correctly parses `.hdbtablemigration` files on Windows
- `compile --to serviceinfo` no longer crashes for Spring configuration in multi-root `yaml` files

## Version 4.6.4 - 2021-03-01

### Fixed

- Fix call to `to.hdi.migration` compiler API
- `cds build` for SAP HANA now correctly passes `sql_mapping` options to new hdimigration compiler API.

## Version 4.6.3 - 2021-02-26

### Added

- [beta] `cds build` for SAP HANA now provides schema evolution support for multitenant application extensions.

### Fixed

- `cds compile --to serviceinfo` returns better results for Java projects
- `cds.connect.to('srv-missing')` called twice with `srv-missing` not configured, would have failed with an error on the first call, but got stuck in the Promise chain for all subsequent calls.
- `.after` handlers are called with result based on request, e.g., array for collection and object for entity, instead of always array
  - Deactivate during two month grace period via compat feature flag `cds.env.features.arrayed_after = true`

## Version 4.6.1 - 2021-02-11

### Added

- [beta] `cds build` for SAP HANA now supports the generation of `hdbmigrationtable` design-time artifacts for big volume tables allowing for schema evolution capabilities. Model entities annotated with `@cds.persistence.journal` will be deployed as `hdbmigrationtable` artifacts instead of `hdbtable`.

## Version 4.5.3 - 2021-02-19

### Fixed

- `cds deploy` and `build` now refer to the latest HDI deployer which supports Node.js 14

## Version 4.5.2 - 2021-02-17

### Fixed

- `cds serve --with-mocks` now also works in `production` environment if `cds.features.mocked_bindings` is true.  Previously, mocks were always disabled in `production`.
- `cds serve` now only fires the `listening` event once
- `cds build` redacts cds configuration data in log messages

## Version 4.5.1 - 2021-02-01

### Fixed

- Update `@sap/cds-runtime` dependency

## Version 4.5.0 - 2021-02-01

### Added

- `cds.server` provides an option to switch off automatically generated `index.html` served at `/`:
  Do that in a custom `server.js`:
  ```js
  const cds = require('@sap/cds')
  // ...
  module.exports = (o) => cds.server({ ...o, index:false })
  ```
- The default `index.html` now honors the system's setting for dark mode.
- Former package `@sap/cds-reflect` is now embedded in `@sap/cds`

### Changed

- Fiori preview is now disabled if `NODE_ENV` is `production`, to avoid any runtime overhead there.  You can enable it with configuration `cds.features.fiori_preview: true`.

### Fixed

- `cds build` now correctly supports multitenant applications defining multiple database modules, e.g. one database for tenant related data and one for shared data.
- `cds deploy --to hana` does no longer fail with an invalid service name error if '.' is used in the MTA ID.

## Version 4.4.10 - 2021-01-18

### Changed

- `cds build` for SAP HANA now only filters csv files if it's needed, e.g. if they contain comment lines.

## Version 4.4.9 - 2021-01-12

### Fixed
- `cds build` for SAP HANA no longer fails sporadically with `ENOENT` when writing CSV files.


## Version 4.4.8 - 2021-01-07

### Fixed

- Add missing setter for `user.locale`

## Version 4.4.7 - 2020-12-18

### Fixed

- `cds build` for Java now also creates a default edmx file (the one w/o language suffix) if the `cds.i18n.languages` array is configured with a set of languages.  Runtime systems expect this file.
- `cds build` now skips empty lines in CSV files when preparing SAP HANA deployment.  This does not happens if the build target folder is `.`, because there CSV files are sources that are not touched.
- `cds build` for SAP HANA now writes CSV files more reliably, avoiding sporadic `ENOENT` errors.

## Version 4.4.6 - 2020-12-08

### Fixed

- Compat `.emit()` for synchronous events with object as first parameter

## Version 4.4.5 - 2020-12-07

### Fixed

- Revert of _cds serve --at / now can overwrite the default /index.html route_, which caused problems in some applications

## Version 4.4.4 - 2020-12-04

### Added

- `cds.User.default` allows to override the default user, e.g. to be `cds.User.Privileged` in tests. By default this is `cds.User.Anonymous`.

### Changed

- `cds compile` and `build` now do a faster localization of edmx files.  If there are no text keys inside these files, the content is no longer duplicated in memory.
- `cds serve --at /` now can overwrite the default `/index.html` route


## Version 4.4.3 - 2020-12-03

### Fixed

- `srv.on` can now be used for async events w/o having to call `next` in each handler
- `srv.emit` constructs instances of `cds.Event` from given arguments, as intended
- `srv.send` constructs instances of `cds.Request` from given arguments
- Revert of: `cds build` filters `i18n` files for nodejs staging builds

## Version 4.4.2 - 2020-12-01

### Added

- `cds.context` always allows access to the current request context when running in Node v12.18 and higher. It uses Node.js' `async_hooks` API for so-called continuation-local storage, and supercedes the need for `srv.tx(req)` in custom handlers.
- Custom functions/actions can now be implemented with plain JavaScript methods in subclasses of `cds.Service`

### Changed

- `cds.unfold` was long-term deprecated, and removed now &rarr; use `cds.compile`
- `cds.config` was long-term deprecated, and removed now &rarr; use `cds.env`
- `cds.session` was long-term deprecated, and removed now &rarr; use `cds.db`

## Version 4.4.1 - 2020-11-27

### Fixed

- When two services `Foo` and `FooBar` were defined, with one services's name being a substring of the other service's name,
  it may have happened that the same EDMX, i.e. that of `FooBar`, was erroneously returned for both.
- On Windows, the index page now shows normalized links to embedded html pages, i.e. `foo/bar.html` instead of `foo\bar.html`.
- `cds build` now consistently uses build target folder `'.'` as default for Java projects - also if custom build tasks have been defined.
- Requests that contain `*` as `Accept-Language` header value do no longer fail.

## Version 4.4.0 - 2020-11-18

### Changed

- Propagate correlation id header to subrequests

### Fixed

- `cds.debug` now reacts on the `DEBUG` environment variable set in a `.env` file
- `cds build` filters `i18n` files for nodejs staging builds
- Language headers with values `en-US-x-[saptrc, sappsd]` are now mapped to user locale `en-US-[saptrc, sappsd]`.
- Messages are kept in their respective request (i.e., not propagated to the request's context, if exists)
- Log requests in atomicity groups
- `cds build` now creates correct custom handler path for nodejs projects in WebIDE fullstack.

## Version 4.3.2 - 2020-12-18

### Fixed

- use `@sap/cds-runtime~2.6`

## Version 4.3.1 - 2020-11-20

### Fixed

- `cds build` now creates correct custom handler path for nodejs projects in WebIDE fullstack.

## Version 4.3.0 - 2020-11-03

### Added

- Helper function `cds.utils.uuid` to generate a UUID
- Support `SELECT[...].limit(0, ...)`
- `hdbtabledata` generation can be disabled using `cds build` task option `skipHdbtabledataGeneration`.

### Changed

- Optimized `cds build` performance when creating OData EDMX output.

### Fixed

- `cds build` now classifies the severity of compile messages the same way as the low-level compiler. As a consequence, messages with severity _warning_ might now be classified as _error_.
- Now, cds CLI logs errors based on _log-level_ setting.
- `cds compile --to sql` no longer creates SQLite-specific views if in `hana` SQL dialect
- The `node-cf` build task of `cds build` now also filters `./` file dependencies from package.json in the build output.


# Version 4.2.8 - 2020-10-27

### Fixed

- `cds compile --to edmx --dest` creates files with `.xml` ending again.


# Version 4.2.7 - 2020-10-26

### Fixed

- Fiori preview finds the `express` package again in the case where no `express` is installed in the application's `node_modules`.


# Version 4.2.6 - 2020-10-26

### Fixed

- `cds run` finds the `express` package again in the case where no `express` is installed in the application's `node_modules`.


# Version 4.2.5 - 2020-10-23

### Fixed

- `cds compile --to edmx-v2` and `edmx-v4` now again write to the folder given with `--dest`.


# Version 4.2.4 - 2020-10-16

### Fixed

- `cds compile --to edmx-v2/4` no longer crashes
- `cds watch` no longer shows an error in absence of model files
- `cds build` no longer fails with an error about module './old/compile'
- Stack trace of some errors have been improved
- The `.hdiconfig` file created by `cds build` now includes HANA artifact types from undeploy.json

# Version 4.2.3 - 2020-10-12

### Fixed

- Leading `#` comments in CSV files sporadically caused `cds build` to fail on Windows with error `EPERM: operation not permitted`.
- Method `req.user.is()` returns boolean

# Version 4.2.2 - 2020-10-07

## Added

- `cds.env.odata.containment` to use OData v4 Containment NavigationProperties feature
- `cds.env.odata.structs` to preserve struct elements as ComplexTypes in OData EDMX instead of flattening
- `cds.env.odata.refs` which uses NavigationProperties in OData EDMX instead of adding foreign keys
- `cds.env.odata.proxies` to add proxy EntityTypes for external Association targets
- `cds.env.odata.flavors` which contain presets for the afore-mentioned flags
- `cds.env.odata.flavor` to choose from the afore-mentioned presets
- `cds.load` option `plain` replacing former option `clean` (which still is silently supported for compatibility).
- `cds.get` now supports option `flavor` with values: `files` | `sources` | `parsed` | `resolved` | `compiled`.
- `sap.common.Currencies`, `Countries`, and `Languages` now have their `code` element annotated with `@Common.Text` pointing to the `name`.  In Fiori's value list with fixed values, this will show the `name` rather than the code itself.  As before, this only has an effect if `@Common.TextArrangement` is set to `#TextOnly` on the entity the code list is used as `ValueList` for.

## Changed

- Replaced `cds.PrivilegedUser` with `cds.User.Privileged`
- `cuid` in `@sap/cds/common` is now defined as an `aspect` to align it with the other definitions.  The previous definition as `abstract entity` is equivalent and was only needed for historic reasons.
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` now skips columns from csv files if the header value is empty.  This allows for ad-hoc 'disabling' of columns.  For SAP HANA, the generated `hdbtabledata` files now also skip empty columns, restoring the behavior from cds 3.
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` has aligned its escaping rules for parsing csv data with SAP HANA's `hdbtabledata`.  A `"` character can be escaped by another `"` as before, but only if contained in a quoted string, i.e. `"A""B"` leads to `A"B`, while `A""B` stays `A""B`, and `""` results in an empty string.

## Fixed

- A `manifest.yml` file is now also generated for nodejs applications if a sqlite database is used.
- `cds build` did not correctly validate custom service handler implementations, warnings have been logged by mistake.
- The default memory size for nodejs applications has been increased in `manifest.yml` to avoid out-of-memory issues for cloud native deployments.
- `cds build` is now correctly creating external CSN output for Java multi-tenant applications.

# Version 4.1.10 - 2020-09-11

## Added

- Much like SQLite deployment, `cds deploy --to hana` and `cds build` can now cope with leading `#` comments in csv files, i.e. the comments get removed before deployment.
- `cds deploy` now can handle empty strings in CSV values (use `""`)

## Fixed
- `cds v` and `cds --version` now work again when called from `npm run` or `npx`.


# Version 4.1.9 - 2020-09-02

## Added

- `cds.PrivilegedUser`, e.g., for transactions with super user

# Version 4.1.8 - 2020-09-02

## Changed

- The `node-cf` build task of `cds build` now removes file dependencies in `package.json` in the build output.  These are anyways not resolvable on CF, but are handy at build time to [refer to other CDS modules](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples/blob/6fdd91b8c810d4367aa6dfc0a91e06dc467686ed/bookshop/package.json#L6).
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` can now cope with leading `#` comments in csv files
- `cds version --all` now includes `@sap/cds-sidecar-client`

## Fixed

- `cds.entities` w/o namespace parameter now works properly when running out of a compiled model (aka `csn.json` aka 'on Cloud Foundry').
- `cds deploy --to hana` now also handles SAP HANA Cloud services on trial, which are created by the `hana` broker (in contrast to the `hanatrial` broker which still provisions older SAP HANA instances).
- `cds deploy --to hana` no longer uses `cf marketplace`, which has changed its parameters in CF CLI v7.
- Fiori preview's html no longer provokes Javascript errors in the Fiori client.
- For DB services of kind `sql` the service implementation is now set correctly in the cds configuration.  Previously, `sql` services got a `sqlite` implementation even if they were set to `hana` in production.
- Custom event handlers that do not register with a path (only with event and function) no longer crash the runtime
- In Typescript typings, the API declaration for `cds.load` and the `bootstrap` event is now fixed.

# Version 4.1.7 - 2020-08-17

## Added

- Shortcut to class `cds.ApplicationService` in cds facade
- Shortcut to class `cds.DatabaseService` in cds facade
- Shortcut to class `cds.RemoteService` in cds facade
- Shortcut to class `cds.MessagingService` in cds facade
- Shortcut to class `cds.Event` as new base class of `cds.Request`

## Fixed

- Race condition on two parallel `cds.connect` to same service
- **`cds deploy --no-save`** extends the list of files it does not modify to `package.json`, `default-env.json` and `connection.properties`
- **Add meaningful error message if hdi-deploy cannot be loaded** &mdash; during `cds deploy --to hana`.

# Version 4.1.6 - 2020-08-07

## Added

- `req.notify()` as a new varient besides `req.info()`, which should display as toaster notifications on Fiori elements or other UIs.

## Fixed

- `req.target` for unbound actions/functions is now `undefined` again, as documented
- Handlers registered with `srv.on(<CRUD>, 'Some/path', ...)` were never invoked
- Queries to remote services via `srv.on(..., ()=> other.read('Something'))` weren't sent to remote

# Version 4.1.5 - 2020-07-31

## Removed

The following changes affect undocumented internal implementations, and hence should not affect CAP-based projects.
Nevertheless, they are listed here for your reference.

- `db.disconnect()` &rarr; no replacement; no need to disconnect before shutdown.
- `db.run(()=>{})` &rarr; use `cds.run([...multiple queries])` instead.


## Changed

- **Most CLI commands have moved** to `@sap/cds-dk`.  Make sure to install the latest version with `npm i -g @sap/cds-dk`.

- **Default OData version** in `cds configuration` is now `v4`. For `Node.js` projects and `Java` projects using new stack the cds configuration of `odata.version = 'v4'` is no longer required. For `Java` projects using old Java stack, OData v2 will still be used.

- **Always do `await cds.connect.to()`** &mdash; in former versions `cds.connect.to()` returned some magic thenables, meant to ease the [_Promise Hell_](https://medium.com/@pyrolistical/how-to-get-out-of-promise-hell-8c20e0ab0513); now it always returns plain-standard Promises. Likely you never used this undocumented former behaviour, but in case: Just ensure to always call `cds.connect` with `await`.

- **Deprecated `cds.connect()`** &mdash; please prefer `cds.connect.to('db')` instead, which has the very same effect but is more in line with the notion of potentially working with multiple database services.

- **Deprecated `cds.hana.syntax` configuration**.  Use `cds.hana.deploy-format`=`hdbtable` instead to switch deployment from `hdbcds` to `hdbtable` for SAP HANA Cloud.

- **Faster generation of `hdbtabledata` files** from csv data.  It no longer tries to check the existence of element or column names.  Such checks are anyways done during SAP HANA deployment.  This behavior is now symmetrical to SQLite deployment.

- **Removed legacy cds build system** &mdash; the fallback using `cds.features.build.legacy` is no longer supported.

- **`cds deploy --to hana` changes kind** to `hana` only if it is not already `sql`.

- **Consistent default naming scheme for applications and services deployed to CF** across the following `cds` commands `build`, `deploy`, `init` and `add`. For an application named `myapp` the SAP HANA deployer app name is `myapp-db-deployer`, the SAP HANA DB service name is `myapp-db`. `cds build` now generates the application manifest file with a different name `manifest.yml`.

- **`cds build`** no longer creates service metadata for the UI service binding by default. For SAP Web IDE Full-Stack compatibility a corresponding metadata.xml is still generated.  A `fiori` build task has to be defined otherwise.

- **`cds build` creates `hana` build results only** if either a corresponding build task has been configured or if kind `hana` or kind `sql` has been defined. A `production` build is required for the latter. A fallback is used for Web IDE Fullstack and legacy build configs.

## Added

- **Common `cds.service.factory`** &mdash; `cds.serve` and `cds.connect` now use a common `cds.service.factory` to construct instances of `cds.Service`, as well as adding custom-provided handlers and implementations. This applies the same consistent ways to register new implementations via `cds.env.requires` options, model annotations `@impl` and `@kind`, or the well known `.cds`/`.js` sibling files mechanism.

- **Common `cds.Service` base class** &mdash; `cds.Service` is the newly introduced common base class for all connected or provided services &mdash; i.e. all service instances contructed thru `cds.service.factory`. It provides uniform consumption APIs, as well as event handling APIs and capabilities for all services.

- **Custom `cds.Service` subclasses** &mdash; besides providing `cds.service.impl` functions as of before, custom service implementations can now return subclasses of `cds.Service`, thereby plugging into the framework even more.

- **New `srv.after('each', row => ...)`** &mdash; the former technique to register per-row handlers `srv.after('READ', each => ...)` broke when code was minified. The new method using pseudo event `'each'` is minifier-safe.

- **New `srv.prepend(srv => ...)`** &mdash; use `srv.prepend(...)` to register event handlers to be executed _before_ the already reistered handlers. For example, extensions of reused implementations sometimes need to use this.

- **Reflect `srv.events`** &mdash; base class `cds.Service` provides a new getter `srv.events` to reflect on declared events in the service definition, similar to the already existing `srv.entities`, `srv.types` and `srv.operations`.

- **Experimental `cds.ql(req)`** &mdash; event handlers can now use the like of `const {SELECT} = cds.ql(req)` to ensure transaction-managed and tenant-isolated execution of queries, instead of `srv.tx(req)`. **Note** though, that this is an **experimental** feature, which might change or be removed in future versions.

- **Using `await` in `cds repl`** &mdash; we now support using `await` directly on `cds repl` prompt inputs. This feature is provided through [Node's _--experimental-repl-await_ option](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html#repl_await_keyword).

- **CLI shortcut `--odata <v2|v4|x4>`** &mdash; the newly introduced general CLI option _**--odata** <v2/v4>_ acts as a shortcut to _--odata-version <v2/v4>_. In addition, _--odata **x4**_ acts as shortcut to _--odata-version v4 --odata-format structured  --odata-containement true_.

- **`cds build --production`** &mdash; builds the project using the `production` profile - same when `NODE_ENV` or `CDS_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`. This will create HANA deployment artifacts if `kind: "sql"` has been defined.

- **`cds build --for <hana|java-cf|node-cf|mtx> --opts <...>`** &mdash; now supports execution of auto-created or configured build tasks. Individual properties can be overwritten by passing corresponding CLI options, defaults are used otherwise. E.g. `cds build --for hana --dest target --opts model=[data,srv,app]`. **Note:** The parameter `options-model` has been deprecated use `--opts model=[...]`instead.

- The set of languages that is honored for the `i18n.json` language pack can now be configured through `i18n.languages`.  Default is still `all`, which means the sum of language files found next to models.

## Fixed
- Fiori preview is now working again with the latest version of SAP UI5.

- **Use latest SAP CommonCryptoLib help** &mdash; when SAP CommonCryptoLib is missing during `cds deploy --to hana`.

- `sql_mapping` is only written to `csn.json` if the classic Java runtime and no default naming is used.

- Fiori dev support in `cds run` now also honors `/v2` URLs.  These are installed by default by the `@sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy`.

- npm scripts that wrap around cds-dk commands like `cds watch` now also work on Windows.  Previously they couldn't find the cds command.

- When extracting the base model of a multi-tenant application `cds build` now ensures that only files having project scope are copied, a warning is logged otherwise.

- `cds build` now no longer crashes if exactly one custom language is given in `options.lang` of the `java-cf` build task.

- `cds compile` now fails with a non-zero exit code in case of compilation errors.

# Version 3.35.0 - 2020-05-08

## Changed
- The new compiler implementation, a.k.a SNAPI, is now the default.  Can be disabled with `cds.features.snapi=false`.

# Version 3.34.3 - 2020-06-19

## Changed

- Faster generation of `hdbtabledata` files from csv data.  It no longer tries to check the existence of element or column names.  Such checks are anyways done during SAP HANA deployment.  This behavior is now symmetrical to SQLite deployment.

# Version 3.34.2 - 2020-05-30

## Changed

- Use `cds.hana.deploy-format`=`hdbtable` instead of `cds.hana.syntax` to switch deployment from `hdbcds` to `hdbtable` for SAP HANA Cloud.
- `cds run` now supports relative `dataSource` URLs in SAP UI5 manifests again, so that UI5 apps can be served w/o approuter.  This support is only active in development mode.
- `cds deploy --to hana` changes kind to `hana` only if it is not already `sql`

## Fixed

- The `UI.Identification` annotation for `sap.common.CodeList` got a correct value, pointing to its `name` element.
- Configuration `requires.<foo>.credentials.destination` is now preserved again when running with `VCAP_SERVICES`.  In version 3.34.1 it was cleared.
- Entities annotated with `@cds.persistence.skip:if-unused` (like `sap.common.Languages`) now again are skipped when compiling to HANA output.  This got broken in previous versions when using the new compiler APIs.
- `sql_mapping` is again written to `csn.json` as it's required by classic Java runtime.
- `default-env.json` is now read even in production, which is in line with the behavior of other modules that honor this file.  Real prod environments like CF will still overwrite these defaults.
- `cds build` caused error `invalid option` &mdash; when passing command line options like `log-level`, `src` or `for`.

# Version 3.34.0 - 2020-04-27

## Added

- `cds version` option `-ls` prints an `npm ls` subtree.
- `cds serve` / `run` now also accept package names as arguments, e.g. `cds serve --project @capire/bookshop`.
- `cds compile` option `--parse` provides minimal, parsed-only CSN output.
- New Node.js method `cds.compile()` allows compiling CDS sources in-process.
- `cds build` now supports cds configuration `requires.db.kind:"sql"` which allows seamless production deployments using HANA db and development deployments using sqlite db.
- Default maximum query size limit of 1000 (overridable via `@cds.query.limit.max`).
- Improved error message during `cds deploy` on Windows when `SAP CommonCryptoLib` is missing.
- `cds build` now checks that `entity-whitelist` and `service-whitelist` have been defined for SaaS applications - a warning is reported otherwise. `cds build` will fail if invalid entries exist.
- Parameter `--vcap-file` lets `cds deploy --to hana` use an existing `default-env.json` file for the deployment credentials, instead of always creating new credentials from Cloud Foundry. Note that this is a beta feature.
- `cds build --log-level` allows to choose which messages to see, default log level is `warn`.
- Labels of `@sap/cds/common` texts are now available in many languages

## Changed

- Node.js method `cds.parse()` has been changed to now truely return parsed-only models, with extensions not applied yet.
**Note:** If you'need the former (erroneous) behaviour, please use `cds.compile` for that from now on.
- Node.js method `cds.get()` now returns parsed-only models; same as `cds.parse()`.
- `cds serve` / `run` / `watch` now reduce logging of details for the bound DB on connect, leading to less clutter.
- Precision for `validTo` and `validFrom` defined in the `temporal` aspect in `@sap/cds/common` changed from `DateTime` to `Timestamp`.
- Some administrative fields of SAP Fiori draft documents are now hidden on the UI.  The rest got labels.
- Renamed cds configuration setting `features.messageLevel` to `log-level` to be consistent with command line option, e.g. `cds build --log-level`.

- `cds extend` and `cds activate` commands have been moved to `@sap/cds-dk`. `cds disconnect` has been moved there under a different name.

## Fixed
- `cds build` - improvements in the area of error handling and error reporting.
- `cds env` and Node.js runtime now properly complete configuration like `requires.db.kind.sql` with VCAP_SERVICES, so that in `production` an SAP HANA service is bound.
- `cds build` now localizes edmx files properly if `cds.env.features.snapi` is turned on.
- `cds deploy --to hana` no longer crashes if called with `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Removed

# Version 3.33.1 - 2020-03-24

## Fixed
- `cds build` now correctly supports options.model definitions of type string
- Details navigation in Fiori preview works again since it's pinned to SAP UI5 1.73.  Actual cause still needs to be investigated.
- `cds deploy` now adds `@sap/hana-client` to package.json instead of `hdb`.
- `cds deploy` adds kind `sql` to requires section.

# Version 3.33.0 - 2020-03-19

## Added
- `cds deploy` uses information from existing `default-env.json`.

- `cds version` now also lists all dependencies of your local package.json and has an updated CLI commend help, documenting option `--all`.
- `cds compile` option `--docs` preserve contents of `/** ... */` doc comments in CSN output as well as in EDMX outputs (as _Core.Description_ annotations).
- `cds compile` option `--clean` tells the compiler to not add any derived information, but return a CSN which reflects only what was actually found in a `.cds` source.
- `cds serve` option `--watch` starts the specific serve command in nodemon watch mode
- Node.js: `cds.env` now supports camel case env variables as well as dot-notated keys in `.env`

## Changed

- Labels for the `createdAt` and `changedAt` in the `@sap/cds/common#managed` entity have been adjusted to reflect the SAP Fiori design guidelines.
- `cds build` now delegates to the modular build system by default (known as `cds build/all`). The modular build system is compatible, but supports additional features, e.g. staging build, SAP HANA Cloud Edition support, populating initial data from .csv by generating .hdbtabledata files, etc. The legacy build is still available as a fallback in case of issues - use setting `cds.features.build.legacy: true` or ENV variable `CDS_FEATURES_BUILD_LEGACY=true`.

## Fixed

- `cds build` now correctly logs warnings returned by cds compiler. The message log level can be customized using cds configuration setting `cds.features.messageLevel` - default is `warn`.
- `cds.env.roots` now properly picks up a changed value of `cds.env.folders`
- `hdbtabledata` is no longer generated for entities that are marked with `@cds.persistence.skip`

## Removed


# Version 3.32.0 - 2020-03-06

## Fixed
- An issue where all Node.js runtime sessions where disconnected when one tenant offboarded.


# Version 3.31.2 - 2020-03-05

## Fixed
- `cds deploy` does not crash if _texts.csv is provided for skipped entities
- `cds serve foo.cds` does no longer load same model twice
- `cds compile --to edmx` no longer creates files with csn instead of edmx content in case no language bundles are found
- Both `cds env` and `cds compile` no longer write terminal escape sequences if only stdout is redirected, but not stderr.
- No longer enforce Node.js version 8 in `db/package.json`.  Cloud Foundry environment does not support it anymore, as this version is out of maintenance.


# Version 3.31.1 - 2020-02-26


## Fixed

- Removed `npm-shrinkwrap.json`


# Version 3.31.0 - 2020-02-25

## Added

Generation of `hdbtabledata` files now reports if CSV file names don't match entity names, and if header names don't match element names in an entity.  Watch out for such logs in case CSV files are not deployed to SAP HANA.

## Fixed

- `cds compile --to hdbtabledata` no longer crashes with `_texts.csv` files referring to a non-`localized` entity
- `cds build/all` adds `app` folder to the list of model folders for HANA database builds. Draft tables are missing if the corresponding annotation model is missing.


# Version 3.30.0 - 2020-02-10

## Added

  - `cds compile --log-level` allows to choose which messages to see
  - `cds deploy --dry` prints DDL statements to stdout instead of executing them
  - `cds deploy --with-mocks` also adds tables for required services
  - `cds serve --mocked` allows mocking individual required services
  - ( &rarr; learn more about these things using `cds help ...` )
  - `cds.env` now also loads from `.env` files in properties format
  - [`cds.resolve/load('*')`](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/api#cds-load) resolves or loads all models in a project including those for required services. It ist controlled and configurable through `cds.env.folders` and `.roots￼``. Try this in `cds repl` launched from your project root to see that in action:
    ```js
    cds.env.folders         // = folders db, srv, app by default
    cds.env.roots           // + schema and services in cwd
    cds.resolve('*',false)  // + models in cds.env.requires
    cds.resolve('*')        // > the resolved existing files
    ```

  - Added `cds.debug(<id>)` as a convenient helper for debug output controlled by `process.env.DEBUG`. For example, use it as follows:
    ```js
    const DEBUG = cds.debug('my-module')
    DEBUG && DEBUG ('my debug info:', foo, ...)
    ```
    ```sh
    > DEBUG=my-module cds run
    ```

  - Added `cds.error(<msg>)` as a convenient helper for throwing errors whose stack traces start from the actual point of invocation. For example, use it as follows:
    ```js
    const {error} = cds
    if (...) throw error `Something's wrong with ${whatever}`
    const foo = bar || error `Bar is missing!` // short circuit exits
    ```

## Changed

  This version brings a major refactoring and streamlining of service runtime implementations,
  which stays fully compatible regarding all documented APIs but in case you used internal
  not documented (non-)APIs, you should know these:

Removed undocumented features

  - Annotation `@source` from models loaded for runtime
  - Property `cds.serve.app` &rarr; use `cds.app` instead
  - Property `source` from CSN entity/view definition objects

> It's very unlikely that you ever used these undocumented internal features at all.
> In case you did, this should never have been done and you should fix that asap.


Deprecated features (&rarr; might get removed in upcoming versions)

  - Property `cds.session` &rarr; use `cds.db` instead
  - Property `cds.options` &rarr; use `cds.db.options` instead
  - Property `cds.unfold` &rarr; use `cds.compile` instead
  - Property `cds.config` &rarr; use `cds.env` instead

> These properties actually where duplicates to the mentioned alternatives.


`cds run` and `cds watch` have been re-implemented as convenience shortcuts to `cds serve`, which acts as the central orchestrator for bootstrapping now.   (&rarr; see `cds run ?` or `cds watch ?` to learn more)

`cds serve` now optionally bootstraps from project-local `./server.js` or  `./srv/server.js`, if exist, thus giving more control while still benefitting from `cds serve`'s intrinsic support for options like `--in-memory` or `--with-mocks`.

`cds serve` now uses `cds.load('*')` to load a single effective model once, assigned to `cds.model`, and reused for db as well as all provided and required services . As that avoids loading models redundantly, it drastically improves both, bootstrapping performance as well as memory consumption.

`cds deploy` does not (have to) register the default models to `package.json` anymore. For example, unlike before, `cds deploy -2 sqlite` will merely add an entry: `db:{kind:'sqlite'}`, without an additional `model` property anymore.

`cds deploy --to hana` does not create `connection.properties` file any longer, but only modify existing one

`modifiedAt` and `modifiedBy` from `@sap/cds/common`
   - Are now mutable for OData, i.e. no longer carry the `@Core.Immutable: true` annotation.
   - Are set by the Node.js runtime whenever the respective row was modified, i.e. also during `CREATE` operations.

Support for `cds init` is now moved to `@sap/cds-dk`.

## Fixed

 - There was a bug in that caused a service names `FooBarV2` to erroneously be mapped to mount point `/foo-barv2` instead of `/foo-bar-v2` as intended and was the case before. &rarr; in case you started a project in this interims phase and had a service name with that pattern you may encounter this fix as an incompatible change, but it's actually reverting to the former compatible way.

 - `cds.env` erroneously overrode profiled entries depending on properties order

 - Fiori preview now uses latest version of SAP UI5 again

 - `cds deploy` verifies returned service key to ensure target service is not of type `managed`.




# Version 3.21.3 - 2020-02-05
## Fixed
- Fiori preview no longer catches service URLs with an arbitrary prefix (e.g. `/foo/browse` instead of just `/browse`).


# Version 3.21.1 - 2020-01-07
## Fixed
- Fiori preview no longer crashes since it's pinned to SAP UI5 1.72.3.  Actual cause still needs to be investigated.

## Version 3.21.0 - 2019-12-11

- `cds add`, `import`, and `watch` now print installation hints if `@sap/cds-dk` is not installed

- Experimental option `hana.syntax=hdi` to create `hdbtable` files instead of `hdbcds`.  May still change!


## Changed

- In development mode, the `mock` authorization strategy is automatically activated with two fake users `alice` and `bob`, which allows for out-of-the-box testing of `@requires` annotations. This means that, unlike before, the `JWT` authorization strategy needs to be activated explicitly (through `{auth: { passport: { strategy: 'mock' }}}`.  In production, no change is required.

- You might see a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error for `@sap/xsenv` in case you use the `JWT` strategy but have not bound any xsuaa service.  In this case either bind such a service instance, add the `@sap/xsenv` dependency, or use a different strategy like `mock`.  The trigger of this error is `@sap/xssec` 2.2.4 no longer requiring `@sap/xsenv`.

- Renovated and streamlined `cds init`. It prints a hint now if it's called with old-style parameters, as well as that it wants to be used from `@sap/cds-dk`. Check out `cds help init` for more.

- Removed the experimental `--args` parameter of `cds compile`.  This turned out to be cumbersome to use in shells. Replacement is the standard configuration mechanism, e.g. use an environment variable `CDS_FOO_BAR` to activate option `cds.foo.bar`.

## Fixed
- `SELECT.one/distinct(Fool,[...])` failed when passing an array for columns as argument two



# Version 3.20.1 - 2019-11-26
## Fixed
- Fix 'duplicate versions' errors by loading `@sap/cds` again from the current project if possible.

# Version 3.20.0 - 2019-11-19

## Added
- Mention xsuaa in help of `cds compile`

## Fixed
- Typings for `UPDATE` function no longer contain duplicates.

- Changes of `@sap/generator-cds` 2.10.2



# Version 3.18.4 - 2019-11-15

## Fixed
- `.cfignore` files now get created by `cds build/all` to improve the overall deployment turnaround
  of `cf push`.  Also, this avoids failures of CF node.js buildpack trying to rebuild sqlite binaries.
- Generated `manifest.yaml` files for Cloud Foundry now contain a `path` attribute that allows
  pushing from an outside folder.  Also, they specify reduced memory requirements.
- Generated `manifest.yaml` for HDI deployer does not create a route, and specifies a valid `health-check-type`.
- `cds deploy --to hana` now also includes models in the `srv` folder.
- `cds deploy` no longer writes model folders to `package.json` that do not exist.


# Version 3.19.0 - 2019-10-31

## Added
- Deployments for sqlite and SAP HANA now find CSV files in the form `_texts_LOCALE.csv`,
  like `Books_texts_fr.csv`.  This file layout allows splitting translated texts into one file
  per language.
- Deployment for sqlite now also imports initial data from JSON files
- `cds version` has learned about `@sap/cds-dk`

## Fixed
- `cds watch --help` works again, if used from `@sap/cds-dk`


# Version 3.18.3 - 2019-10-28
## Fixed
- Fixed a crash in `cds run --watch` with changing directories.
- `cds watch` is now also found if called from an NPM script.
- `cds watch` now uses the same lookup paths for models as `cds run`


# Version 3.18.1 - 2019-10-17
## Fixed
- Fixed a crash during sqlite deployment if there were csv files that did not match an entity name
- `cds deploy --to hana` now does a build for SAP HANA even if no matching build task is available.
- `cds deploy` now tries to add `.gitignore` entries only once
- In `@source` annotations of csn.json files generated for cloud deployments,
  now posix file paths (with `/`) are written, and no Windows paths.
- `cds serve` and `run` now shuts down gracefully in case of `SIGHUP` signals emitted by
  e.g. the VS Code terminal.
- `cds watch` now is found even if `@sap/cds-dk` is not installed locally.

# Version 3.18.0 - 2019-10-09

## Added
- Compiler options for SAP HANA backend can now be set in configuration in the `cdsc.toHana` block
  (e.g. `cds.cdsc.toHana.joins`)
- `service.tx()` as a shortcut for `service.transaction()`

## Fixed
- `cds deploy --to hana` now adds the tunnel address to the JDBC URL
- Boolean and number values from `default-env.json` now are accepted in configuration (`cds env`)
- For applications deployed to Cloud Foundry, custom handlers are now properly resolved using their names.
- `cds serve`/`run` now properly log `$batch` requests of OData

## Added
- `cds run` has learned a new `--watch` option, which provides automatic restarts of the server on file changes.  [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package is required for this to work.

## Fixed
- `cds deploy` now writes `true` and `false` values in csv files as boolean to sqlite
- Console output of `cds run` now waits until the server is really up and running before it declares success.
- `cds deploy` and `build/all` do not write `hdbtabledata` files if some are already present.

## Also see
- Changes of `@sap/cds-compiler` 1.17.1



# Version 3.16.0 - 2019-08-22

## Added
- `cds run` has learned a new `--in-memory` option, which connects and deploys to an SQLite in-memory database. There is no need to call `cds deploy` before.
- `cds deploy --to hana` now can also be executed in Java projects
- `cds run`'s index.html got a favicon, to give a visual clue in browsers.
- `cds.requires.<datasource>.model` configuration can now also point to a node.js module, e.g. `@my/module`.
  Previously, only a relative file path was supported.
- Improved logging of query objects
- `cds compile` now understands `--to edmx-v2` and `--to edmx-v4` to produce OData metadata of versions 2 or 4, respectively.

## Changed
- Fiori preview in `cds run` now is only added if OData services are being served.
  For other protocols like `rest`, no Fiori preview is provided.  Same holds true for the `$metadata` link.
- `cds compile` now behaves better in non-TTY scenarios (e.g. when piping to files).  It writes a proper JSON
  string instead of a Javascript object.  Previously, one had to enforce JSON using the `--to json` processor.  Compare e.g. the output of `cds compile model.cds` to `cds compile model.cds > model.json`.

## Fixed
- Fiori preview in `cds run` now also works for services with namespaces
- In services of CF marketplace, `cds deploy --to hana` now only accepts services with plan `hdi-shared`.
  Previously, it could get confused with services of type `hana` but of other (non-HDI) plans.
- Localized edmx files are now produced also for i18n.json files.

# Version 3.15.0 - 2019-07-26

## Added
- `hdbtabledata` files are now generated automatically as part of `cds deploy --to hana` for given set of CSV files.  CSV file names must follow the pattern `<namespace>-entity.csv` (same as for SQLite deployment) and be located in `db/csv` or `db/data`.
- For Node.js, multiple configuration profiles can now be activated at the same time, e.g. by setting both `NODE_ENV` and `CDS_ENV`, or by setting a multi-value list: `CDS_ENV=profile1,profile2`.
- New labels for `sap.common.*.code` and `sap.common.Currencies.symbol` (part of `@sap/cds/common`).
- Better message for `Duplicate definition` errors, where the same `cds` file is referenced from different locations.
  To fix this, check all dependencies to `@sap/cds` in your package.json and those of reused packages and ensure they allow deduped use of `@sap/cds`.

# Version 3.14.0 - 2019-07-11

## Added
- Support for `SELECT.distinct.from(Foo)` and `SELECT.one.from(Foo)` queries in Node.js
- [Beta] `cds deploy --to hana` deploys to SAP HANA on Cloud Foundry
- For Node.js, `cds env` now activates the `development` profile automatically,
  unless `CDS_ENV` or `NODE_ENV` are set.  This is in line with `NODE_ENV` defaulting to `development`.

# Version 3.12.0 - 2019-06-17

## Added
- On request, `cds build/all` now generates OData EDMX files for node.js services
- Performance optimizations for `cds build/all`

## Fixed
- `cds deploy` no longer fails if `data` dir is not present
- `cds build/all` no longer prints a message if `mta.yaml` does not exist

# Version 3.11.0 - 2019-06-03

## Added

- `cds deploy` now also finds `.csv` files in imported reuse packages
- Better error messages for various `cds` CLI calls

## Changed
- `cds build/all` for Node.js projects generates proper CSN in `gen/csn.json`.
   A warning is emitted if `cds serve` is run with the previous format.  Rebuild the project if you see this warning.

# Version 3.10.0 - 2019-05-21

## Added
- Tables and view for localized entities are created by default now, both for HANA and SQLite.
- Internal errors are now marked as such in all CLI commands, with a request to report them.

## Changed
- `cds compile --service all` no longer fails in case no services are found.
  This better matches higher level commands like `cds build` that should not fail in this instance.
  Note that `--service Foo` fails as before in case `Foo` is not found.
- `cds run` and `cds serve` now serve the generic index page at `/`, while previously this was `/$index`.
- `cds build/all` now auto-creates build tasks from `mta.yaml` definition if no build tasks have been
  defined in `.cdsrc.json`. If no `mta.yaml` file exists, cds configuration data respectively defaults
  are used for build task configuration.

## Fixed
- CLI now shows compilation warnings in all commands, e.g. in `build`, `deploy`, or `compile`.
  Previously warnings were only shown in case of compilation errors.
- `cds help` no longer inserts terminal escape sequences if stdout is redirected to a file.
- Errors in custom handlers are no longer shadowed in `cds serve` or `cds run`.

# Version 3.6.0 - 2019-02-27

## Added
- In `cds init`:
  - Add modules via `cds init --modules` to an existing project.
  - Do not allow project creation via `cds init` outside of current working folder, e.g. init ../../some/where/else is not allowed.
  - No output at all (not even error messages) when using `cds init --quiet`.
  - Create a module folder using `cds init --modules...` even if it is empty based on the supplied options.
  - Parameter `--modules` only supports one folder of each type.
- Alpha support for `@cds.odata.valuelist`: Adding `@cds.odata.valuelist` to `@cds.autoexposed` entities will automatically equip all associations referring to such entities with a corresponding `@Common.ValueList.entity`

## Changed

# Version 3.5.2 - 2019-02-20

## Fixed
- Node.js projects created with `cds init` now
  - Bind the service module to an HDI service in `mta.yaml`.
  - Invoke CDS build when building the database module.
  - No longer create old-style `service` configuration in `package.json`.
- For datasources with kind `hana` we now also find `hanatrial` services in trial landscapes by matching their tag `hana`.



# Version 3.5.1 - 2019-02-14

## Fixed
- In `cds serve` service providers where added twice to the express app.  This is fixed.
- In the logs of `cds serve` false warnings on fiori requests are now gone.

## Fixed
- Service handlers are now also found on CF if CDS models are served from a `csn.json` file instead as from `.cds` sources.
- An issue where projects w/o `db` dir could not be built using `cds build`.
- Unclear documentation of `cds deploy` on where it looks up the data source.

# Version 3.0.0
## Changed
- Reworked configuration options to center around required 'data sources'.
  - As an example see the snippted that e.g. `cds deploy --to sqlite:my.db` generates into `package.json`.
  - The former `cds` options from `package.json` are deprectated but still supported.
- Clean up of many Node.js APIs, mainly for `cds.serve` and `cds.connect`.  See the [Javacript APIs documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/a131984aefe94ff884e6b6819ee76bd9.html) for details.

Same as version 2.3.2, but including the generic service provider for Node.js (`@sap/cds-services` and `@sap/cds-ql`).


# Version 2.3.2
## Changed
- The default for SQL name mapping is changed to `plain`.  This means that
  - The name of a table/view in the database catalog is obtained from the name of the corresponding entity in the CDS model in the following way:
    - replace all "." by "_"
    - convert everything to upper case
  - The name of a table/view column in the database catalog is obtained from the name of the corresponding entity element in the csn in the following way:
    - convert everything to upper case

  Note that this is a breaking change for appliations that rely on the previous value of `quoted`.  In order to get this value back, add the following to `package.json`: `"cds": { "data": { "sql_mapping" : "quoted" } }`

## Fixes
- Special output formatting in CLI is only done for `cds eval` and `cds repl`, but not for programmatic usage.
- Links to external documentation are now point to correct help documents.

# Version 2.3.0
## Added
- SQL names can now be configured with `{ data: {sql_mapping: "plain/quoted"} }`.  Default is `quoted`, but will be changed to `plain` soon.  If you need to stay with `quoted` in the futute, e.g. due to data compatibility reasons, you can configure this mode already now.

## Fixes
- The `csn.json` file produced by `cds build` now contains the properly unfolded model for OData.  Previously this was the normalized model, which led to runtime errors in the Java service provider.
- Invalid configuration data in `package.json` now leads to a build error again.
- Console output of `cds build` now presents files paths sorted.

# Version 2.2.0
## Added
- CDS configuration in `package.json` can now be omitted if you follow the standard project layout, i.e. if you place your model files in `db/`, `srv/`, and `app/` folders.

## Changed
- Previously data models needed to include import statements to the service models (e.g. `using from '../srv'`), so that the Java runtime could use these service views on the DB to execute queries.  The views are now included automatically, so that you can remove the explict `using` clauses.
- Calling just `cds` on the command line now prints its help.  The previously started REPL is now available with `cds repl` (or just `cds r`).

## Fixes
- Some cds commands failed on Windows.  This is fixed.

# Version 2.1.0
## Added
- Service edmx files are now written to UI app folders if their manifest.json contains a reference to the service.  This allows Web IDE's annotation modeler to work on up to date service files.
- The results of `cds.compile.to...` commands are now automatically formatted if called in `cds -e...` or cds repl.  You don't need to append `console.log` to the call chain.

## Fixes
- Language properties are now found in all folders, also ones that are outside of the current module
- csn.json is written with line breaks and indentation

# Version 2.0.0
## Added
- All-new command-line interface.  See `cds help` for information on the available commands.
- `cds compile` exposes CDS model transformations with various options.
- `cds build` automatically writes localized edmx files.
- `cds build` now writes the version to the build log.
- `cds version` does the usual thing.
- `cds init` scaffolds CDS projects.
- CDS repl (read-eval-print-loop): just type `cds` and play with CDS API.

## Fixes
Too many to mention :)
